[{"content":"So I started a new part-time position this week and today was my first day - remote, ofcourse. I\u0026rsquo;m supposed to be a Malware Analyst - analyzing malwares and creating reports. It\u0026rsquo;s a new role for me since most of my experience has been in development, but I have always wanted to give core Security roles a try so I\u0026rsquo;m looking forward to this.\nBut anyways, point being - while researching today, I came across this hack that occurred in March earlier this year:\nAttackers spoofed 2 commits to the official PHP Repo - supposedly as \u0026ldquo;typo fixes\u0026rdquo; (which as we can see, clearly were not). These added lines looked for a new USER_AGENTT header in a request and executed whatever came after the string zerodium, as PHP code.\nI actually didn\u0026rsquo;t come across this news directly. I found some delibrately malicious programs during my research that had a very similar code in Python. They create a new endpoint via Flask and intercepted the USER_AGENTT header\u0026rsquo;s value to any request made.\nI was a bit confused when I first came across this exploit. Being the noob I am, I got hung up on the fact that they only ran the string as code when zerodium was present as a prefix. \u0026ldquo;Is there someone/some organization by the name of \u0026lsquo;Zerodium\u0026rsquo; that gets to control what is executed?\u0026quot; I thought I was onto something big for a second.\nAnd then I Googled and realised it was an actual thing that had occurred in the past. What\u0026rsquo;s more, \u0026ldquo;Zerodium\u0026rdquo; was indeed the name of a company that bought exploits/bugs for large sums of money. However, they didn\u0026rsquo;t have anything to do with this - it was merely a troll from the attackers to use their name, claiming to have sold it to them.\nI wanted to mess around with it a bit so I replicated the Python implementation in another file, fired up the Flask server and sent some requests via Postman to see it in action. And sure enough:\nI suppose this is quite straightforward and something like this is not likely to happen so easily. Only reason this was even possible was because PHP\u0026rsquo;s git server got compromised. The actual saunce behind the whole attack probably lies there. The maintainers did switch completely to GitHub shortly after where organizational access and other security measures would prevent something like this from happening in the future.\nIn anycase, I thought this was something cool + it\u0026rsquo;s my first time doing this kind of research so I guess I was just a bit excited :P\nWell anyways, till next time.\n","permalink":"https://m0mosenpai.com/posts/4_zerodium/zerodium/","summary":"So I started a new part-time position this week and today was my first day - remote, ofcourse.

I felt like it was simple problem - one which seemed to have an obvious solution, yet something that might frustrate a lot of people just starting out with Python.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s go over the problem first. You can follow along by cloning the repo from here.\n In the following directory structure, file test_import.py is attempting to import a function import_me from import_me/utils/package. Upon running python test_import.py, you get the an error. Why does this happen and how will you solve it?\n Let\u0026rsquo;s run the file first and see what error we get exactly: Hmmm\u0026hellip;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, I know! There was this one time I found this StackOverflow answer that suggested me to use python -m instead of python and do this weird dot notation thing with the files. Well idk what any of this means, but it should work right?\u0026quot; Hmmmmmmmm\u0026hellip;\nSo what just happened?\nMy first thoughts after seeing the error were that it most likely had something to do with PYTHONPATH. That\u0026rsquo;s the environment variable Python uses to look for modules and packages. The path stored in that variable is considered the root and everything below it in the directory structure is accessible. Everything above it is not.\nEven if my hunch was correct, I needed a way to verify this. The interviewer suggested me to use the sys module and print out the contents of PYTHONPATH in both the cases.\nImporting sys and adding a print statement for sys.path, we can notice something interesting between the two cases: Well, my intuition was right.\nYou can execute Python files in 2 ways: either as scripts (python script.py) or as modules (python -m package.module.func). Scripts are generally meant to be run and do something whereas modules are created for the purpose of importing them into other files and using them as libraries.\nIn the first case, Python only knows about the directory the script ran from. This means anything above that directly is inaccessible. Whereas in the second case, since Python traversed recursively through packages, all the way from the root directory to find the module we wanted it to run, it\u0026rsquo;s aware of everything that lies below the root directory, and not just the directory the script ran from. This explains the ModuleNotFound perfectly.\nSo how do we fix this? We could simply run it as a module and call it a day.\nBut what if we really want to run the file as a script? Well then, how about adding the path of the root directory to PYTHONPATH? This should allow Python to see module despite the file being run a script. Let\u0026rsquo;s try it out: And there we go! We can see that our newly exported path indeed shows up in the environment and now Python is able to find the function easily.\nI\u0026rsquo;m not sure situations would arise where one would have to do this in a professional setting. But I do believe it\u0026rsquo;s a good way to explain the fundamental concept behind Python modules, packages and it\u0026rsquo;s import system. A neat explanation of these terms can be found over at Real Python, a website I highly recommend to everyone for learning Python.\nTill next time.
